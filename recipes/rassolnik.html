    <h1>Rassolnik</h1>
        <h4>Description</h4>
        <p>Rassolnik is a traditional russian recipe that I learned how to make when I was living in Belgium. I absolutely love this soup and tend to add more pickles as thats my favorite. See below for the ingredients list</p>
        <h4>Ingredients</h4>
        <ul>
            <li>2 pounds of stew beef</li>
            <li>1/2 cabbage</li>
            <li>Carrots</li>
            <li>1 large onion</li>
            <li>4 potatoes</li>
            <li>Barley</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>How to make</h4>
        <p>First I boil the water and add in the beef. As the beef is cooking I shave off carrots, cut the cabbage to strips. I cut up the potatoes into small squares and add them to the stew.</p>
        <p>I add the carrots and cabbage to a pan and cook. Once the cabbage and carrots are cooked I add them to the beef stew. I then add my chopped pickles and a 2 cups of pickle juice. I leave it cooking for 4 hours on low heat. Then enjoy with a dallop of daisy sour cream. Very good and easy to make.</p>
